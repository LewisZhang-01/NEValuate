CHRYSLER, TAKE A LESSON FROM TOYOTA AND FIX THESE FRAMES BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH AND THEIR FRAME BREAKS.  MY JEEP WAS TOTALLY BONE STOCK WHEN THIS WAS DISCOVERED.  I'M NOT TRYING TO GET A DOLLAR BACK FOR WHAT I PAID, JUST TRYING TO BRING AWARENESS TO THIS AS HAVE MANY OTHERS.  JEEPERS LOVER THEIR JEEPS NO DOUBT AND ARE VERY LOYAL TO THE BRAND.

HE SAID THERE ARE NO DRAIN HOLES ON BOTTOM OF THE JEEP FRAME, BUT ONLY HOLES THAT THE MANUFACTURER PUT ON THE SIDE OF THE FRAME. HE SAID, AS A RESULT ROAD GRIME ENTERED THE FRAME FROM THESE MANUFACTURED SIDE HOLES, GOT TRAPPED INSIDE THE FRAME AND CAUSED IT TO RUST FROM THE INSIDE OUT. HE SAID THAT IS WHY I HAD NOT DETECTED THE SEVERITY OF THE RUST PROBLEM BEFORE NOW. THE SHOP OWNER PUT HIS HAND INSIDE THE FRAME AND PULLED OUT A HANDFUL OF MOIST ROAD GRIME AND LOOSE RUST FLAKES TO FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM.

FROM DAY ONE I STARTED EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS. MANY OF THEM I RETURNED TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. SOME THEY WERE ABLE TO FIX, OTHERS, AFTER MANY RETURN TRIPS, THEY WERE 'UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM'. 1.  GAUGES WOULD STOP WORKING WHILE DRIVING - I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN 5 TIMES BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO DUPLICATE AND FINALLY FIX THE PROBLEM. 2.  THIS WAS ALSO TRUE OF THE BLINKERS THAT NOT ALWAYS WORKED - OR WORKED ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  3.   MY HAZARDS STILL DO NOT WORK EVERY TIME. 4. THE AIR CONDITIONER GOES OUT WHEN DRIVING,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN IT IS HOT AND RAINING. 5. THE SOUND BAR HAS NEVER WORKED PROPERLY - FIRST IT WOULD ONLY COME IN SOME TIMES - NOW NEVER.  6.  HEADERS ARE CRACKED - BAD. THEY HAVE BEEN WELDED SEVERAL TIMES. WHEN I WENT TO HAVE THEM WELDED IT WAS FOUND THEY WERE WELDED BEFORE MY PURCHASE - AT 3600 MIL!  THEY ARE STILL CRACKED, WELDING DOES NOT HOLD. I CAN NOT GET ANYONE TO REPLACE THEM BECAUSE EVEN EXHAUST SPECIALISTS SAY IT IS TOO CUMBERSOME. THE DEALER CHARGES WAY MORE THAN I HAVE CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF REPAIRS AND THE PRICE OF GAS - AT 12 MPG.  7.  DRIVERS SEAT BELT LOCKS TIGHTLY WITH ANY AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES - IT HAS NOW GOTTEN TO THE POINT IT LOCKS JUST WHILE DRIVING.  8.  WINDOWS - THE ZIPPERS BROKE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY - I PAID ALOT TO HAVE THESE REPLACED. THE BACK WINDOW NOW HAS A CUT IN IT AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THROUGH. 9.  THE TOP HAS NEVER QUITE FIT RIGHT; IT HAS ALWAYS LEAKED AND BEEN EXTREMELY NOISY - MORE SO THAN ANYONE ELSE'S THAT I KNOW. IT HAS ALSO COME APART AT THE SEAMS.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN OF ANY HELP. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNTS JUST FOR DIAGNOSTICS, EVEN WHEN I HAD THE BEST WARRANTY. I'VE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE DOOR MOLDING COMING OUT IMMEDIATELY, GRINDING IN THE STEERING WHEEL, GRINDING WHILE TRYING TO PUT IT IN REVERSE AND MORE.    *NLM",

UPON RETURNING HOME FROM WORK I NOTICED A VERY STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE, UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION I FOUND THE FUEL RUNNING AT A STEAY STREAM ONTO MY DRIVEWAY FROM THE JEEP I HAD FILLED UP THE PREVIOUS EVENING.  I ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK AND STOP IT, HOWEVER I WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  I REMOVED THE FUEL TANK FROM THE VEHICLE AND FOUND THE FUEL TO BE LEAKING AROUND THE RETAINING RING FOR THE FUEL PUMP THAT IS INSTALLED IN THE FUEL TANK.  I CHECKED THE SCREW ON RETAINING RING FOR TIGHTNESS AND FOUND IT TO BE SECURE AND SNUG ON THE TANK.  THE RING IS A SCREW ON TYPE COLLAR MADE OF HARDENED PLASTIC, WHICH HOLDS THE FUEL PUMP IN THE TANK, THE FUEL PUMP SITS ON A FLAT RUBBER GASKET WHICH SITS ON THE LIP OF THE PLASTIC GAS TANK.  UPON REMOVING THE RETAINING RING AND LIFTING THE FUEL PUMP OUT OF THE TANK I NOTICED THE GASKET WAS CRIMPED AND TORN ON THE TOP FLAT PORTION OF THE GASKET.   I CONTACTED THE OWNER TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE GASKET TEAR, THE OWNER CLAIMED TO HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE IN FOR A FAULTY FUEL LEVEL INDICATOR A COUPLE MONTHS EARLIER.  WHICH WAS INLINE WITH WHAT I HAD ASSUMED SEEING AS THE FUEL TANK HAD GREASE PENCIL WRITING ON TOP OF THE TANK INDICATING A TECHNICIANS INITIALS, DATE AND MILEAGE.   THIS PROBABLY EXPLAINS THE TORN GASKET, HOWEVER UPON OBTAINING A NEW GASKET AND ATTEMPTING TO REINSTALL THE NEW GASKET IN THE TANK WITH THE FUEL PUMP I NOTICED THE REASON THE GASKET PROBABLY TORE, THE RETAINING RING HAS A TENDENCY TO GRAB THE GASKET AND TURN IT AS THE RING SEATS ITSELF.  I WAS VERY CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS WHILE INSTALLING THIS RING AND GASKET CONSIDERING I DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER GASKET AND I DID NOT WANT TO TEAR THIS REPLACEMENT PART.  I NEED MORE ROOM TO FINISH.

I ASKED THEM IF THIS MEANS THAT IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENT, THE AIRBAG WON'T DEPLOY BECAUSE THE COMPUTER ALREADY THINKS IT HAS.  THEY WALK AROUND THE SUBJECT SAYING THAT THIS HAS BEEN A COMMONLY REPORTED FAILURE IN THE NEW JEEPS, YET I HAVE SEEN NO RECALL INFORMATION ON IT.  THEY TOLD ME THEY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF BAD ELECTRICAL HARNESSES THAT CONTROL THE AIRBAG FROM THEIR MEXICO PLANT AND EVEN THE NEW REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE FAILING.  I WORRY THAT MY AIRBAG WILL NOT WORK WHEN THE TIME COMES AND THEY REFUSE TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH IT IS UNDER WARRENTY AND IS BEING FIXED FOR THE FOURTH TIME FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.
