I EVEN CHECKED WITH THE JEEP DEALER HERE IN OKLAHOMA AND WAS TOLD IT COULD BE THE BALL JOINTS, STEERING CYLINDER AND/OR EVEN WORN TIRES.  HE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM.  MY MECHANIC SAID THE BALL JOINTS WERE GOOD... THE TIRES JUST OK.  BUT STEERING CYLINDER WOULD PROBABLY NEED REPLACING.  SO I PAID $145.00 TO THE JEEP/CHRYSLER DEALER FOR A NEW STEERING CYLINDER.

I PROCEEDED DOWN THE HIGHWAY, BUT, AFTER ABOUT A MILE, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SHAKE/WOBBLE WILDLY AGAIN (ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLY), TO THE POINT WHERE I LITERALLY THOUGHT THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL WAS FALLING OFF.  LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SHOULDER WITHOUT CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  I DROVE SLOWLY ALONG THE SHOULDER, EXITED THE HIGHWAY AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY, AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP.  AFTER MAKING SURE THAT THE LUG-NUTS WERE TIGHT, I DROVE (VIA CITY STREETS, TO MINIMIZE SPEED) BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WHEEL BALANCING.    THAT SAID, WHEN I HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD, THE VEHICLE'S RIGHT FRONT END STILL WOBBLES.  IN THE INTERIM, I DID SOME GOOGLE'ING, AND I FOUND THAT NUMEROUS OTHER (?DEATH WOBBLE?) CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED NATIONWIDE (INCLUDING HUNDREDS TO THE NHTSA).  CHRYSLER HAS ISSUED MULTIPLE TSBS, AND THERE IS A MAINTENANCE NOTICE ACKNOWLEDGING ?STEERING VIBRATION? (A MONUMENTAL EUPHEMISM; THE ISSUE GOES WAY BEYOND A SIMPLE VIBRATION) ON THE JEEP WEBSITE.  IN SHORT, CHRYSLER IS WELL-AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE AND SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM.  THE MATTER HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY A SAN FRANCISCO TV STATION (KGO-TV), AND EVEN TWO MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS WHO SENT INQUIRIES/COMPLAINTS TO BOTH CHRYSLER.  DESPITE ALL OF THE FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS, PUBLICITY, AND REQUESTS FOR ACTION, THE NHTSA HAS DONE NOTHING.    THIS IS CLEARLY A DESIGN FLAW/DEFECT, AND THE NHTSA NEEDS TO FORCE CHRYSLER TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL.  JEEP OWNERS NEED TO BE MADE AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE/POSSIBILITY OF THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION, AND CHRYSLER SHOULD INCUR THE COSTS OF ITS DIAGNOSIS AND CORRECTION.  *TR",

THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT IS TO ACCELERATE TO HIGHER SPEED OR TO SLOW DOWN.   I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY DID A AN ALIGNMENT. THE SHAKING STOPPED AND 1 MONTH LATER IT STARTED AGAIN.  A YEAR LATER, OF JUST PUTTING UP WITH THIS I BRING THE JEEP BACK TO THE DEALER. THEY TELL ME THAT THE CAUSE IS FROM WORN  TIE RODS AND STEERING DAMPER WORN.   IF THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE SHAKE THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THIS A YEAR AGO. I THINK THE WORN PARTS ARE A RESULT FROM THE SHAKE. NOT THE CAUSE. EITHER WAY , THE JEEP NOW HAS 26,000 MILES AND I'M ALREADY BEING TOLD TO PUT 2000 DOLLARS INTO IT FOR WORN PARTS. THESE PARTS ARE WEARING PREMATURELY BECAUSE OF THE SHAKE BUT NO ONE CAN DETERMINE THE CAUSE. IF I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR NEW , I COULD HAVE USED THE LEMON LAW BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I BOUGHT IT WITH LOW MILEAGE USED.   THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND WONDERING IF IT WILL TAKE A DEATH FOR SOMEONE TO RECALL THESE LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH TOYOTA ACCELERATOR.

NOT ONLY DOES THIS GET GAS ON MY VEHICLE AND PERSON, THIS SPILLS GAS ALL OVER THE PUMP HANDLE AND GROUND AT THE STATION.  THIS IS A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE TO MYSELF, DAMAGING TO MY VEHICLES PAINT, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DANGEROUS.    I HAVE READ OF A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH THIS ISSUE ON THEIR JEEP VEHICLES.  I WOULD EXPECT JEEP WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CORRECTING THIS ISSUE DUE TO THE DANGEROUS, WASTEFUL, AND SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE CONDITION.  FOR ME PERSONALLY, I DON'T EXPECT THAT WITH 46K MILES ON MY JEEP THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN, AND BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OWNER TO FIX.    I HOPE THAT THERE CAN BE SOME ACTION TAKEN TO HOLD JEEP RESPONSIBLE,  AND REMEDY THIS (COMMON) ISSUE.    THANK YOU.  *TR",

THE VEHICLE SHOOK FOR 2-3 SECONDS THEN I HEARD A \"POP\", INSTANTLY THIS THREW MY VEHICLE WHERE IT FLIPPED AND ROLLED AND TOTALED THE VEHICLE.  I HAD TO BE AIRLIFTED AWAY AS A RESULT OF THIS ACCIDENT.  INVESTIGATORS FROM JEEP AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY BOTH CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS A PRODUCT DEFECT THAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.  WHILE TAKING UP THE ISSUE WITH BF GOODRICH THEY ADVISED ME TO TAKE THE TIRE IN TO BE INSPECTED.  THE TIRE STORE STATED AFTER ABOUT 10 SECONDS OF LOOKING AT THE TIRE THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY A ROAD HAZARD.  I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING AT ALL DURING THIS 4 HOUR TRIP THAT I WAS JUST ON AND THE TIRE WAS INFLATED AT 35 PSI.  BF GOODRICH DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE ACCIDENT OR MY INJURIES.  THEY DID OFFER ME 30% OFF A NEW TIRE.  TOO BAD I DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE TO PUT A TIRE ON ANYMORE.  I CHECKED THE AIR PRESSURE PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIP FROM SAN DIEGO TO PHOENIX.  I ALSO FILLED UP WITH GAS AND WALKED AROUND THE JEEP, TO WASH THE WINDOWS, AND DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TIRES.  THE ROAD THAT I WAS TRAVELING ON WAS WELL MAINTAINED AND FREE FROM OBJECTS.  I DID NOT RUN OVER ANYTHING.  I DO HAVE CUSTODY OF THE BAD TIRE STILL ON THE RIM AND PLENTY OF PICTURES OF THE TIRE AND THE VEHICLE AFTER THE ACCIDENT.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE TIRE FAILURE CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.

THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED - I PURCHASED THE JEEP IN ST. AUGUSTINE, FL IN JAN., 2011 & I HAD TO GET GAS RIGHT AFTER PURCHASING IT. THE FIRST TIME I HAD THE AUTO SHUT-OFF ON THE GAS FILLER - IT CLICKED OFF & GAS STARTED FLOWING BACK OUT OF THE TANK. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THE GAS FILLER NOZZLE WAS DEFECTIVE, & NOTIFIED THE CONVENIENCE STORE ABOUT THE OVERFLOW - I ASKED FOR SOME \"DRY AGENT\" TO CAPTURE THE GAS THAT HAD SPILLED OVER. THE ATTENDANT SHUT THE PUMP STATION DOWN, & SAID THEY WOULD CALL SOMEONE TO CHECK OUT THE FILLER NOZZLE. THE NEXT TIME THAT I NEEDED GAS (BACK IN ORLANDO, FL) THE JEEP WAS BACK NEAR EMPTY (FUEL LIGHT \"ON\"). I USED THE AUTO CLICK-OFF ON THE FILLER - SAME[XXX], DIFFERENT DAY! I HEARD THE \"CLICK\" OF THE AUTO-SHUT OFF & WITHIN A SECOND, GAS WAS POURING BACK OUT OF THE FUEL NECK OF THE JEEP. PEOPLE WHO WERE PUMPING THEIR OWN GAS HEARD THE FUEL COME OUT OF THE TANK (AND HEARD ME CURSE, LOL!) THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAW. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH FUEL POURED BACK OUT OF THE FUEL NECK OF THE JEEP (AND THE TANK FOR THAT MATTER), BUT THERE WAS A POOL OF FUEL ON THE GROUND. I NOTIFIED THE FUEL ATTENDANT OF THE SITUATION & THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY DRY-SORB CHEMICAL TO ABSORB THE FUEL. I USED PAPER TOWELS TO CLEAN IT UP. NOW I HAVE TO RESORT TO FILL THE JEEP WITH NO MORE THAN 12 GALLONS (NO MORE SHAKING OR THE FUEL MAY COME BACK OUT). I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE INTERNAL VALVE IS DEFECTIVE OR THAT THE USE OF ETHANOL IN THE JEEP HAS DESTROYED THE INTERNAL VALVE. I DON'T GIVE A [XXX] WHAT HAS CAUSED IT - THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF JEEPS THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM - DO YOUR JOB NHTSA.GOV!!!

BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS SO HARD TO COME BY APPARENTLY.  WITHIN 2 MOS THE SWITCH FOR THE FAN WENT OUT AGAIN. HAD TO WAIT ANOTHER 3 MOS. (ON BACK ORDER)   THE GEAR SHIFTER CABLE BROKE NEXT AND HAD CAR TOWED AND REPAIRED.  ALSO, IT WAS RUNNING EXTREMELY HOT,  I WOULD HAVE TO SHUT VEH. DOWN TO COOL.  THEN TO TOP IT OFF ON AUG. 13TH 2010 THE TRANS FELL OUT ON MY WAY TO WORK.  I BOUGHT THE VEH ON APR 1ST (FOOLS DAY)  AND BOY WAS I FOOLED.  I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A DEPENDABLE, RELIABLE VEH.

I HAVE OWNED NUMEROUS VEH. AND NOT PAID NEAR THE PRICE I DID FOR THIS JEEP AND THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.  BE SMART DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID. IF YOU DO BUY A JEEP BETTER BUY IT BRAND NEW UNDER WARRANTY CAUSE YOU WILL NEED IT. BIG TIME. AND GET OUT FROM UNDER IT BEFORE THE WARRANTY GOES OUT.  THE DEALERSHIP NOR THE MANUFACTURES OF THE JEEP WERE WILLING TO HELP ME AT ALL.  I WAS STUCK WITH IT AND NOTHING I COULD DO.  I AM JUST NOW (6 MOS. LATER)REBUILDING THE TRANS.

THE REPLACEMENT OF THE DRIVE GEAR DID NOTHING TO ELIMINATE THE CHIRPING. THERE WAS SOME WEAR ON THE DRIVE GEAR WHEN IT WAS REPLACED. A SEARCH ON JEEPFORUM.COM INDICATES THE PROBLEM WITH THE OPDA IS A BUSHING THAT ISN'T GETTING OIL, DUE TO A SEAL THAT IS BLOCKING OIL FLOW.

CHRYSLER  RELEASED A SERVICE BULLETIN (E05) REFERENCE THIS ISSUE, BUT REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE OPDA IS OF FAULTY DESIGN AND CONTINUES TO SUPPLY FAULTY OPDA'S WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS IN FACT SUPPLIED.

THE PROBLEM IS THE TEETH ON THE ASSOCIATED GEARS FOR THE SYNCHRONIZER AND THE CAMSHAFT PARTS PREMATURELY WEAR OUT CAUSING PLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO GEARS THUS ACTIVATING THE SENSOR WHICH THEN CAUSES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO BE ILLUMINATED.

WITHIN ONE WEEK OF DRIVING THIS VEHICLE I EXPERIENCED SEVERE WOBBLE (AKA \"DEATH WOBBLE\") WHILE TRAVELING AROUND 55MPH TWICE. IT HAPPENED WHEN I RAN OVER ROUGH AREAS IN THE ROAD THAT HAD BEEN PATCHED UP POT HOLES. THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE. I HAD TO ALMOST COME TO A COMPLETE STOP BEFORE IT WOULD STOP DO THIS. I FELT I HAD NO CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING. AFTER THE FIRST TIME I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM AND THAT MANY, MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING. IT IS REFERRED TO AS THE \"JEEP DEATH WOBBLE\".   I CONTACTED THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THE JEEP IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. WHEN I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION TO THEM THEY ACTED AS IF THEY NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING. THEY REPLACED THE DAMPER ON THE STEERING BUT I KNOW FROM MY RESEARCH THAT THIS IS JUST A SHORT TIME \\\"FIX\\\" AND THAT ALTHOUGH CHRYSLER HAS RECEIVED MANY LETTERS FROM CONSUMERS SUCH AS MYSELF, THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THEIR DESIGN IF DANGEROUS THEREFORE, THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL TO PERMANENTLY FIX THE PROBLEM.     I THEN CONTACTED X-TREME JEEPS IN TAMPA FLORIDA AND THE OWNER INFORMED ME THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM IS TO ELIMINATE THE DAMPER ALL TOGETHER AND INSTALL THE RUGGED RIDGE STEERING KIT WHICH ACTUALLY BRINGS THE MECHANISM BACK TO THE OLDER WAY THE JEEPS WERE MADE BACK WHEN AMC BUILT THEM. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE JOB, COSTING APPROX. $330. I CAN NOT AFFORD THIS PLUS THE MONTHLY CAR PAYMENT BUT THEN AGAIN, I CAN\\'T AFFORD TO WRECK MY VEHICLE DO TO POOR DESIGN. I LIVE 17 MILES FROM MY JOB AND CAN\\'T AFFORD TO GO WITHOUT MY TRANSPORTATION. THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE VEHICLE CHRYSLER DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE RESPONSIBLE.    WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP MY JEEP FROM THE DEALERSHIP AFTER THEY REPLACED THE DAMPER I HAD TO COME UP WITH $83.63 FOR THE ROTATION/BALANCE OF THE TIRES.

THE LATEST INCIDENT INVOLVING MY JEEP AND GOODYEAR TIRES TRANSPIRED TWO DAYS AGO. I NOTICED THE TIRE WAS LOSING AIR BEFORE I GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL. CONSIDERING I WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE ON A HIGHWAY, IT MAY HAVE BEEN RECIPE FOR DISASTER. I PUT AIR BACK INTO THE TIRE AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO A SEARS AUTOMOTIVE CENTER. THE MECHANICS INFORMED ME THAT THE TIRE HAD A \"SIDEWALL FAILURE\" AND WAS UNFIXABLE. SEARS DID STATE THAT THE TIRES HAD LITTLE TO NO WEAR ON THEM AND WERE \"LIKE NEW\". I CONTACTED GOODYEAR PERTAINING TO THE ISSUES. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS NOT ENTIRELY HELPFUL. I GAVE MY HISTORY WITH THE GOODYEAR TIRES AND THE JEEP WRANGLER TO GOODYEAR. I WAS TOLD TO SEEK A SECOND OPINION BY GOODYEAR. I HAD ANOTHER GOODYEAR RETAILER LOOK AT THE TIRE WITH THE SAME RESULT. I CONTACTED GOODYEAR AGAIN. GOODYEAR WAS QUITE UNHELPFUL AND I FELT \"BLOWN OFF\". I SINCERELY HAVE A CONCERN THAT EVERY TIME I GET IN MY JEEP ONE OF MY TIRES MAY BECOME DAMAGED. JEEP WRANGLERS ARE AN SUV, SO THE CHANCES OF ROLLOVER ARE HIGHER. THE FIRST TIRE THAT WENT ON MY CURRENT 2006 JEEP WRANGLER ALMOST CASED ME TO SPIN OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION. THAT INCIDENT TRANSPIRED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2006. I AM HOPING THAT THIS COMPLAINT WILL INSPIRE SOME SORT OF INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRODUCT, GOODYEAR DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN DOING SO. EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THERE ARE JEEP WRANGLERS ON THE ROAD, MANY OF THEM WITH THESE SAME GOODYEAR GS-A TIRES. THAT IS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE POTENTIALLY AT RISK, ALONG WITH THOSE WHO MAY BE TRAVELING AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, I HONESTLY HOPE THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED AND APPROACHED FOR THE POTENTIALLY SERIOUS MANNER THAT IT IS.  *TR",

IF IT IS DONE AT A NORMAL SHIFT RATE IT ACTUALLY CLIPS SECOND GEAR (AND MAKES AN ASSOCIATED CLIPPING/GRINDING NOISE). PAUSING IN NEUTRAL AND RESTING THE SHIFTER AGAINST SECOND, YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL TWO OR THREE GEAR TEETH GO BY BEFORE IT WILL DROP INTO GEAR. TO GET IT TO SHIFT SMOOTHLY WITHOUT CLIPPING GEAR TEETH REQUIRES A LONG ENOUGH DELAY IN NEUTRAL THAT FOLLOWING TRAFFIC ALMOST REAR ENDS THE VEHICLE. THE DRIVER IS ESSENTIALLY FACED WITH THE DECISION OF DAMAGING THE TRANSMISSION OR RISKING GETTING REAR ENDED. DOUBLE CLUTCHING THE VEHICLE HELPS, BUT OBVIOUSLY SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED FOR A FULLY SYNCHRONIZED TRANSMISSION. TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALER AT 1164 MILES AND 1306 MILES, BUT THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS CLAIM THEY CANNOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY ADJUSTED AND LUBRICATED THE LINKAGE AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE.

NEW FOR THE 2006 JEEP WRANGLER IS THE SIX SPEED TRANSMISSIONS AND WHAT I HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED THE HARD WAY IS PART OF THE REDESIGN INCLUDES THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY.  THE CLUTCH ROD COMES OUT OF THE FLOOR BOARD AND ATTACHES TO THE CLUTCH PEDAL WITH A CLIP/ATTACHMENT THAT BOLTS ONTO THE CLUTCH PEDAL.  THE PROBLEM HERE IS AS PART OF THEIR NEW DESIGN THE CLIP OR ATTACHMENT PIECE IS MADE OF ??PLASTIC?? AND I FOUND THAT IT CAN BREAK VERY EASILY AND DISABLE YOUR JEEP.  I LEARNED THIS FACT THIS LAST WEEKEND AND IF I HAD BEEN ROCK CLIMBING OR IN THE DESERT INSTEAD OF IN TOWN I MIGHT NOT BE HERE LETTING ALL YOU JEEP OWNERS KNOW ABOUT THIS VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM.  IN ADDITION TO THIS PROBLEM AND BEING 165 MILES FROM HOME I HAD A BIG EYE OPENER ON HOW RUDE, UNCOOPERATIVE, UNCARING AND TOTALLY UNHELPFUL I FOUND  CORPORATION TO BE.  READ THE DETAILS OF MY PAST WEEKEND AND DAIMLER CHRYSLER SEE HOW DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY THIS PROBLEM CAN BE UNLESS DAIMLER CHRYSLER CORPORATION CORRECTS IT!  I ALMOST FORGOT TO MENTION THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A WARRANTED PART IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE PROBLEM FOR ME AS WELL.  *NM",
