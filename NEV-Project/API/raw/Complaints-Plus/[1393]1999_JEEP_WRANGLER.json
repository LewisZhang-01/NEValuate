AS I TURNED THE WHEEL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, TO GO AROUND A LARGE DOWNED TREE, IT MOMENTARILY SHUT OFF, THEN RETURNED TO ON. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE JEEP OFF AND CHECKED THE AIRBAG FUSES.

I'VE TRIED TO PULL THE MOUNTS CLOSER FOR A BETTER CONNECTION. IT SEAMED TO WORK FOR A WHILE. THEN IT COMES BACK. A GOOD SOUND BEATING ON THE DASH BRINGS THEM BACK ON. AMAZING WHAT THAT PLASTIC WILL TAKE. ALL THIS STARTED AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED. I REFUSE TO TAKE IT IN AND POUR MONEY AT IT TILL THEY FIGURE IT OUT.   ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW HOW TO FIX THE GAUGES. I'M ABOUT READY TO CUT THE WIRES AND SOLDER THEM DIRECTLY ON.    2ND ISSUE:  I BEGAN SMELLING PLASTIC BURNING OR SOMETHING. LATER THE HEATER FAN QUIT WORKING.

I HAD TO CALL JEEP TO FIND OUT IF IT WAS COVERED UNDER A WARRANTY, THE WARRANTY ENDED AT 70000 MILES. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES FOR ESTIMATES AND INFORMTION. NONE SAID THAT THE CRACKS, TWO AT TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS, COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN 4000 MILES. ONE IS LOCATED ON A TIGHT BEND ON THE PIPE. I ASKED THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS PROBLEM, HE SAID THAT TEMPETURE CHANGES. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO NEVER TOLD ME THAT IT WAS TWO CRACKS. JUST SAID THERE WAS ONE. THEY ALSO SAID THEY DID NOT DETECT IT THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE MAYBE IT WAS NOT AS ABVIOUS. THE LOCATIONS OF ONE OF THE CRACKS CAN EASILY BE SEEN IF ONE CHANGES THE OIL, THE OTHER CAN BE SEEN BY LIGTING THE HOOD AND LOOKING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE. THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEF THAT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT COMPLETE A MAJOR CHECK OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE MAJOR SERVICE.

WITH HIS FOOT FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE, HE SHIFTED INTO DRIVE, SUDDENLY THE ENGINE REVVED HIGH, AND THE VEHICLE LUNGED FORWARD, STRIKING A TOYOTA RAV4 PARKED IN FRONT.
