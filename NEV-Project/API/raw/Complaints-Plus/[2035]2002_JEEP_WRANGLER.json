I BOUGHT THE TIRES TO AVOID A BLOWOUT WHILE TOWING. ON JANUARY 20 WE STARTED OUR SEASONAL TRIP TO FLORIDA. ABOUT 4:00 PM, THE LEFT FRONT TIRE CAME APART DESTROYING THE FENDER, TURN SIGNAL, SIDE MARKER, BENT FRONT BUMPER, RIPPED THE WIRING FROM THE RV THAT CONTROLS LIGHTS, AS WELL AS THE FRONT JEEP WIRING LEFT SIDE. WHEN I STOPPED, NOTHING BUT A PIECE OF WIRE WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE FRONT RIM. NO RUBBER AND THE ALLOY RIM DAMAGED BEYOND USE. AT THAT POINT I JUST THOUGHT I PICKED UP A NAIL AND GOT A FLAT. THANK GOODNESS I HAD A NEW SPARE WAS MY THOUGHT. THE NEXT DAY, 1/21/18, ABOUT 3:00 PM THE RIGHT REAR TIRE CAME APART AND WHEN I GOT STOPPED THE ONLY THING LEFT WAS ABOUT AN INCH WHERE THE TIRE MEETS THE RIM, 2 RINGS OF RUBBER. I HAD TO HAVE THE JEEP TOWED TO THE NEAREST TIRE CENTER, FIRESTONE COMPLETE AUTO CARE. THERE, I NOTICED THAT THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE HAD SMALL PIECES OF RUBBER MISSING. I REPLACED ALL THE REMAINING GOODYEAR TIRES. I CONTACTED BOTH WALMART AND GOODYEAR. GOODYEAR HAD ME FILL OUT A CLAIM FORM, NUMBER 601521. THEY MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE AND THE 2 PIECES SHIPPED BACK TO THEM. I RECEIVED A CERTIFIED FORM LETTER STATING THE ONE TIRE HAS NORMAL WEAR (CHUNKS OF RUBBER MISSING IS NORMAL WEAR?) AND MANUFACTURED FINE. I CONTACTED GOODYEAR BY PHONE AND ASKED HOW THAT DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE WHEN TWO NEW TIRES, ONE DAY APART, CAME APART AND A THIRD SHOWING SIGNS OF A PROBLEM.  SINCE THEY DONT HAVE A TIRE TO EXAMINE THEY CLAIM THE PROBLEM IS NOT THEIRS. THEY SAID TO SEND PICTURES. THE RESULT WAS THE SAME. I HAVE REQUESTED THAT THE TIRE BE RETURNED TO MY RESIDENCE. I HAVE MORE THAN $4000 DAMAGE TO MY JEEP, AND A MANUFACTURER THATS STANDING IN ANOTHER WORLD. THEY CONVENIENTLY LOST THE TWO RUBBER RINGS, BLAMING IT ON FEDEX.",

AS I WALKED OUT THE DOOR I NOTICED THREE FIREMEN LOOKING UNDER AND AROUND MY 2002 JEEP WRANGLER. WHEN I ASKED WHAT WAS GOING ON THE FIREMEN INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A STRONG SMELL OF GAS REPORTED BY ON OF MY NEIGHBORS!     TURN OUT THE SMELL WAS GASOLINE AND WAS INDEED ORIGINATING FROM MY 2002 JEEP WRANGLER. WE BROUGHT THE JEEP INTO THE SHOP AND THE DEALERSHIP WAS ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE AND INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A SOLENOID PURGE VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM THAT WENT BAD AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE EXCESS FUEL IS DISCHARGED OUT THE EXHAUST SYSTEM AND THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE SMELLING. THE FAILURE OF THIS COMPONENT CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO RUN RICH, FOUL SPARK PLUGS, REDUCE MILEAGE AND YES, THERE'S THE CONCERN OVER THE EXCESS FUEL, NOT TO MENTION THE \"CHECK ENGINE LIGHT\" WAS ALSO NOW ON.    THE JEEP HAS ~32K MILES AND IS NOW PAST 3 YEARS (3YR/36MILES) HOWEVER WE PURCHASED THE \"EXTENDED WARRANTY\" WHICH AS IT TURNS OUT DOES NOT COVER THIS FAILED COMPONENT. COST $180.00 TO US.    MY CONCERNS:   1. FIRE HAZARD? THE SMELL WAS VERY STRONG! STRONG ENOUGH TO WARRANT A VISIT BY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT!   2. FUEL ECONOMY....$2.15/GALLON FOR 87 OCTANE  3. ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS? THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT IS THE EXCESS FUEL IS ROUTED STRAIGHT OUT THE EXHAUST SYSTEM! DO I REALLY WANT TO GO OFF READING WITH THIS VEHICLE SPEWING EXCESS GASOLINE OUT THE EXHAUST AS I TAKE IN THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED?   MY QUESTION:  IS THIS COMPONENT FAILURE COMMON? IS THE FAILURE MODE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY? ARE THERE ANY CONCERNS TO MY WELL BEING IN THE EVENT WE HAVE A RECURRENCE? HAS ANYONE SEEN THIS BEFORE?",
