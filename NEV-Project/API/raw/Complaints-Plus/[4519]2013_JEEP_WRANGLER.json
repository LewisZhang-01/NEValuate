        "summary": "I own a 2013 Wrangler Unlimited. Since new, the parking brake has been ever-more-difficult to engage. On October 26, I was using the Jeep around my property and had to exit the vehicle while in neutral (auto transmission) and attempted to engage the parking brake.  If the handle is pulled slowly, SOMETIMES the brake engages enough to hold.  In this particular instance, I pulled the handle slowly, felt some resistance to indicate the brake engaged, and exited the vehicle.  The brake then relieved enough pressure to allow the vehicle to roll back into a hole form where a stump had been.  Fortunately I was not injured and the Jeep did not collide with anything.  This emphasized to me a previously-known safety issue with the product.  The design of the brake lever is supposed to be self-adjusting, however in reality, the clutch mechanism to do this allows slippage to the point where the handle hits the backstop prior to engaging the brakes on many Wrangler JKs that are only a few years old. This is a well documented problem in JK forums and many owners have created workarounds to force the mechanism to maintain tension on the parking brake cables. I have not done this to mine, and consequentially have not had a reliably functioning for years.  For obvious reasons, this flaw in the parking brake design (especially on vehicles offered with manual transmissions puts public safety at risk.   Ilderton Chrysler Jeep Dodge in Winston Salem failed this vehicle on safety inspection in 2020 as a result of this, but I did not authorize a diagnostic investigation, as I was already aware of the problem.  I was able to jiggle the parking brake enough to cause it to engage enough to pass inspection.  Within 1 - 2 pulls, the brake was completely unusable again.  I have checked parking brake shoe to drum clearance and verified that the rear is adjusted correctly for engagement. The problem only exists in the design of the lever.  No warning lamps related to the lever/integrated switch.",

I THEN TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL JEEP, CHRYSLER, RAM DEALER TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND OUT THAT THE CYLINDER HEADS ON THE PENTASTAR ENGINE IN THE 2012 AND 2013 JEEP WRANGLERS WERE HAVE MANY, MANY ISSUES WITH THE BAD CYLINDER HEADS BECAUSE OF THERE WAS TWO DIFFERENT METALS USED BETWEEN THE ENGINE BLOCK AND THE CYLINDER HEAD CAUSING IT TO WARP AND CAUSE COMPRESSION ISSUES IN THE CYLINDER. JEEP WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT REFUSED TO THIS DAY TO ISSUE A RECALL. AFTER THE DEALER TOOK THE ENGINE APART TO INVESTIGATE, HE ADMITTED TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS A BAD CYLINDER HEAD. THIS MISFIRE ON CYLINDER 6 OCCURRED MOSTLY WHEN IDLING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR AT VERY LOW SPEEDS. THE KICKER IN ALL OF THIS EVEN THOUGH JEEP ADMITTED A FAULTY CYLINDER HEAD WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF COMPRESSION, THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE THE CYLINDER HEAD AT THEIR COST. BECAUSE JEEP DID NOT HAVE MY VIN NUMBER IN THEIR LIST TO BE REPAIRED, IT WAS UP TO ME TO PICK UP THE COST. I DID NOTHING IN THE TIME THAT I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE (ORIGINAL OWNER) TO MAKE A CYLINDER HEAD BECOME WARPED. THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PENTASTAR ENGINE FROM THE BEGINNING.

THE POLICE SHOWED UP AND HELPED ME PUSH IT OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AT THAT POINT I TRIED TO START IT, APPROXIMATELY 10MINS AFTER STALLING AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP. I WENT STRAIGHT TO AUTOZONE AND HAD A NEW BATTERY INSTALLED, $250.00 AND GOT GOING ON MY WAY HOME - FAT, DUMB AND HAPPY - UNTIL 2 DAYS LATER WHEN IT DID IT AGAIN. THE SECOND TIME IT STALLED I WAS ON A BUSY 12 LANE INTERSTATE 95 IN DOWNTOWN MIAMI. AGAIN I DID NOT KNOW IT HAD STALLED, I WAS INCREASING SPEED FROM ABOUT 50MPH TO 60MPH AND PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL AND NOTHING HAPPENED. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF 6 LANES AND IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAZARDS ON AND ROLLED THROUGH TRAFFIC ONTO THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE. I WAITED 5 MINS AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP AND I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHRYSLER DEALER IN KENDALL, FL. THEY GAVE ME A RENTAL VEHICLE - THANK GOD. ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER THEY CHANGED OUT THE PCM AND GAVE IT BACK TO ME - FIXED (SUPPOSEDLY). 2 WEEKS LATER IT STALLED IN TRAFFIC ON A 4 LANE HWY; WAITED 5 MINS AND IT STARTED FINE, WAS LATER AT THE STORE GOT IN THE VEHICLE AND IT WOULD NOT START JUST KEPT TRYING TO CRANK ITSELF, WAITED 5 MINS LATER AND IT STARTED. THAT WEEKEND TOOK IT TO CHRYSLER IN TAMPA (JERRY ULM) THEY SAID IT IS NOT IN MY WARRANTY AND I PAID $400.00 FOR WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS A CHRYSLER \"WORK AROUND\". 2 DAYS LATER IT WOULD NOT START AND IT TRIED TO CRANK ITSELF.

BACK IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR, YOU SENT ME TWO RECALL NOTICES CONCERNING THE HEATED MIRRORS ON JEEP WRANGLERS. AT THE TIME, I REMOVED THE FUSE FROM POSITION M35 TO DISABLE THIS FEATURE PER THE NOTICES, AND WAITED FOR THE LETTER ANNOUNCING THAT PARTS WERE AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THE CONDITION. THAT LETTER CAME SOMETIME IN MARCH AND I CALLED THE NUMBER TO SCHEDULE AN       APPOINTMENT SOMETIME IN MID-APRIL AND WAS SCHEDULED FOR REPAIRS ON 5/20/15 AT 7:00AM. I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THE GIRL MAKING THE APPOINTMENT THAT I DID NOT HAVE A RIDE AND WOULD HAVE TO WAIT ON MY VEHICLE. SHE TOLD ME THAT WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM IF I GOT THERE ON TIME AND THEY COULD MOVE IT THROUGH PRETTY QUICKLY.    YESTERDAY (5/19/15) A RECORDED MESSAGE WAS LEFT ON MY VOICE MAIL REMINDING OF THE APPOINTMENT TODAY. SO FAR SO GOOD.     THIS MORNING IS WHERE THE INCONVENIENCE OCCURRED. AFTER ARRIVING AT THE DEALER AT 7:00AM, I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WERE RUNNING BEHIND AND STILL HAD 11 VEHICLES LEFT OVER FROM YESTERDAY. THEY SAID THEY COULD PROBABLY GET TO MINE LATE THIS     AFTERNOON, OR POSSIBLY TOMORROW MORNING. SINCE THIS JEEP IS MY ONLY VEHICLE, THAT IS VIRTUALLY AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR ME. I HAD ALREADY REARRANGED MY SCHEDULE TO BE THERE THIS MORNING.    NOW I STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NO RESOLUTION.

THEY HOLD MY JEEP IN THEIR SHOP FOR TWO DAYS. COMMUNICATIONS WITH SERVICE ADVISOR/DEPARTMENT WERE HORRIBLE.

THE JEEP?S AIRBAGS FAILED TO DEPLOY AND I SUSTAINED A FRACTURED NOSE, FACIAL LACERATIONS, FACIAL CONTUSIONS AND A CONTUSION TO MY STERNUM.

DID NOT RUN IT OR TRY TO START IT YESTERDAY.    9/30/13 JEEP WOULD NOT START & WHEN I JUMPED IT THE UCONNECT SYSTEM WOULD NOT WORK..  TOOK IT TO DEALER.  THEY THINK THE RADIO IS DRAWING CURRENT FROM BATTERY. THEY REPLACED RADIO.    10/21/13. JEEP WOULD NOT START AFTER SETTING TWO DAYS.  TOOK IT BACK TO JASPER JEEP.  THEY ARE GOING TO TRY PUTTING A NEW BATTERY IN IT UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE A BATTERY POST.  SERVICE MANAGER CHECKED THE RECORDS AND COULD NOT FIND WHERE A NEW BATTERY HAD BEEN INSTALLED PRIOR TO PURCHASE.  12/30/13  9:15AM TRIED TO START JEEP, IT WOULD NOT START.  GOT CLICKING SOUND LIKE LOW BATTERY, INTERIOR DASH LIGHTS WERE ON.  THERE WAS A NEW DASH WARNING LIGHT ON, IT IS A RED LIGHTING BOLT.    9:38AM. STARTED IT & AFTER IT WAS CONNECTED TO \"START CAR\" FOR A MINUTE IT STARTED. LET IT RUN FOR A COUPLE MINUTES SHUT IT OFF & IT STARTED OK. RED LIGHTING BOLT NOT ON.    FOUND SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED BY CHRYSLER, SEPT 2013.  BULLETIN NUMBER: SB-08-067-13: NHTSA  ITEM NUMBER - 10053694    10:30 AM CALLED ABOUT THE SERVICE BULLETIN.  THE SERV. MGR.

        "summary": "WHILE TRAVELING DOWN A HIGHWAY AT 55, I ADJUSTED MY POSITION IN THE SEAT. THE VEHICLE WAS IN CRUISE CONTROL. I PLACED MY FEET ON THE CARPET IN FRONT OF THE SEAT AND PUSHED MYSELF UP AND BACK INTO THE SEAT TO ADJUST MY COMFORT AND POSITION.  THE CARPET AND CARPET MAT WENT UP INTO THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATOR PEDALS.  THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO ACCELERATE. WITH MY FEET I PULLED THE CARPET AND THE MAT BACK AND OUT OF THE PEDALS.  STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND MOVED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. I GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE TO SEE THE CAUSE.    THE DRIVER SIDE CARPET IS A SEPARATE PIECE OF CARPET WITH A MAT ATTACHED BY A HOOK THAT IS PART OF THE CARPET.  THE CARPET DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY BACKING.  IT LOOKS SPUN. THE DRIVER POSITION CARPET IS A SEPARATE PIECE THAT TERMINATES ABOUT 6 TO 10 INCHES UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT. THE CARPET HAS HOLES THAT ALLOW THE DRIVER SEAT FRAME TO ATTACH TO THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT CLAMPING THE CARPET DOWN.  THERE IS NO CLAMPING FORCE HOLDING THE CARPET DOWN UNDER THE DRIVER SEAT.  THE CARPET END UNDER THE SEAT IS PLACED UNDER THE CARPET COMING FROM THE BACK SEAT.  I DID NOT NOTICE ANY ATTACHMENT BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK CARPET TO HOLD THE CARPET IN PLACE.     MY ACTION OF PUSH WITH MY FEET TO ADJUST MY COMFORT AND POSITION RIPPED THE CARPET ON THE OUTSIDE EDGE BY THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR AND STRETCHED THE CARPET ON THE RIGHT SIDE, WHICH LET THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CARPET TO MOVE UP INTO THE BREAK AND ACCELERATOR PEDALS.    I REPLACED CARPET MAT WITH THE HARD MOLDED RUBBER MATS.  THESE MATS SEEM TO KEEP THE CARPET AND MATS FROM MOVING UP INTO THE PEDALS.  THE MATS AND CARPET STILL SHIFT FORWARD AND I HAVE TO ADJUST THEM WHEN THE CARPET GETS TOO FAR FORWARD.  *TR",
