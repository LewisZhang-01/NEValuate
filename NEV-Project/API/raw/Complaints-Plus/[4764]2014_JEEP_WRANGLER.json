Found the following in my search: \"  ATTENTION - 2014 Wranglers have bad oil leak problems! ________________________________________ For 2014, Chrysler made a change to a part called the \"oil filter adapter\" which sits on top of the engine, under the intake manifold. There are now a parade of people with various Chrysler vehicles that use the 3.6L reporting that the new part cracks, causing a major oil leak, potentially a fire, and can cause your engine to be drained of all oil.  If you have had an oil leak, and the dealership told you the issue was the oil filter adapter, the oil cooler or the oil cooler cover, post up here. We are going to try to get pressure on Chrysler to at least redesign the part.  Part number is 68105583AA and it applies only to 2014 3.6L Chrysler V6 engines, at least so far. Similar issues have been reported with the new 3.2L V6 used in the Cherokee, but it apparently has a different part number.  This is a MAJOR issue if you own a 2014 Wrangler. There is no way to know if/when the part will crack, and if it does, it is not a trail repair. The adapter is buried under the intake manifold, and ever getting to it with some putty would be nearly impossible. You had better have extra oil with you at all times if you are trail riding a 2014 Wrangler.  Post here if you have the issue, and go to safercar.gov and file a complaint. If Chrysler doesn't fix this issue, you will never feel safe wheeling your 2014 Jeep in the backcountry. They need to fix this, NOW.  ALL 3.6L vehicles are affected\"",

There was no CEL or warning. Checked oil and it was over a quart low. Oil spill under vehicle was large and dissipated in a wide area. A quick web search shows this is a common issue on the Chrysler Pentastar 3.6 engine. It is the OIL COOLANT HOUSING ASSEMBLY which is faulty. This causes oil to spill out and drip on the transmission and exhaust which causes the oil burning smell. There was a backorder on this part and I was informed that over 65K parts were manufactured and sold this past year which demonstrates that this is a known issue. Attempted to have dealership repair but could not book a date for months due to backlog and lack of availability. Took the vehicle to an independent shop that was very familiar with the issue and confirmed it was the oil coolant housing assembly without me mentioning what I thought it was. This was a $975 repair. Contacted manufacturer and they said they could not assist me as I need to take the vehicle to the dealership (only). However, I can't be without my vehicle for 60 days until they are able to \"fit me in\". Concerned about the burning of oil on the exhaust from a safety/fire perspective.",

It's made of plastic (that cracks) with plastic gaskets (that shrink/crack over time).  It's a known problem, has been reported by many, especially for vehicles in cold weather areas.  Due to the location of the oil cooler assembly, it can't be easily replaced without spending over a thousand dollars and then the dealers don't stand behind or warranty the new part/their install because they know the replacement is just plastic and going to crack again.  Oil leaks all over other engine components (transmission, transfer case, etc.), which could cause the vehicle to catch on fire; an accident due to the leaked on components being deteriorated and not working properly from being oil soaked; or cause the engine oil to overheat since the cooling assembly isn't working correctly.  Repair requires complete disassembly of the upper engine and the OEM replacement is just another faulty plastic parts.  Repairs are extremely costly IF you can even find parts.  OEM had to know about this issue---plastic parts are never good and hopefully no one will get hurt because you could be driving a long time before you even know you have a problem.",

Upon inspection by 2 independent shops, it was determined that there was no physical damage or reason for the failure.  The repair to the issue is for the entire fuel tank to be replaced at a cost of approximately $2,000.  The vehicle has only 65,000 miles on it and used on highway driving conditions.  The concern is that a manufacturing or design defect is the cause and because of the hazard created by the leak, is a serious issue and should be addressed by Jeep.  Jeep has acknowledged that this issue should not occur and has offered some minimal assistance on repair costs, however my concern is with having to replace an entire fuel tank at 65,000 miles on a Jeep product and the safety concerns with the potential for this to occur without a root cause (other than product failure or defect).  This should not be considered a 'wear and tear' part and have a much longer life than 65,000 miles.  In addition, due to the design of the part, requires the entire fuel tank to be replaced at an excessive cost.  The consumer expectation from Jeep is for a much more rugged, dependable and safe product which is what Jeep promises in their marketing and promise to consumers.",

Upon speaking with over 15 dealerships in Southern California, they noted that there were over 40,000 of this replacement part on back-order as of March 2020.   I had to wait two months to get the part delivered, which meant I went two months without a vehicle, and then had to pay over $800+ on a part + labor on an item that should absolutely be recalled. There are thousands of posts on Wrangler Forum and other Jeep pages that share the exact same issue. Jeep has ignored this issue since 2014, and it's only occurring in more vehicles now. This part breaking can cause engine seizure or failure and should not be a cost to the customer as there is CLEARLY a nation-wide problem that Chrysler is ignoring.",

WELL, I DID AS HE ASKED, BUT CORPORATE CUSTOMER CARE IS USELESS, WILL NOT REACH OUT TO THE TECH AS ASKED, AND ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO NOT PAY BECAUSE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THERE IS NOT A RECALL. EITHER WAY, THIS ISSUE CAN START A FIRE IF LEFT UNFIXED. JEEP KNOWS THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE, YET WILL NOT DO A RECALL UNLESS FORCED (MONEY OVER SAFETY).

MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTING ON ITS OWN WAS COMING UP A STREET WHERE I DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND GEAR....THE JEEP THEN SHIFTED INTO 1ST ON ITS OWN AND THEN UPSHIFTED TO 3RD, THEN DOWN TO 2ND & THEN TO 1ST, ALL ON ITS OWN. I THEN CAME TO A STOP SIGN & PUT IT BACK INTO DRIVE FOR AUTOMATIC HOPING THAT IT WOULD STOP. FOR ABOUT 2-3 WEEKS AFTER THAT, IT SEEMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE & THEN NOTHING. IT DROVE FINE. I NEVER TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FROM THAT ONE OR TWO INSTANCES. ON 8/5/19 I TOOK MY JEEP IN FOR A REGULAR OIL CHANGE. KONA KWIK LUBE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING & SAID THAT EVERYTHING ON THE JKU LOOKED GREAT. I THEN HAD TO LEAVE TOWN FOR A WEEK & UPON RETURN FROM THE MAINLAND, I HAD NUMEROUS DROPS (OF WHAT I THOUGHT WAS OIL) ON THE FLOOR OF MY CARPORT. I TOOK MY JEEP TO REPAIR SHOP FOR DIAGNOSTIC & WAS TOLD THAT THEY SAW SIGNS OF OIL LEAK FROM THE OIL FILTER HOUSING, BUT WERE UNABLE TO PINPOINT LOCATION OF LEAK. AS I KNEW THE MANAGER OF KKL, I TOOK IT BACK THERE. THEY CLEANED UP THE AREA & STATED THAT IT WAS NOT OIL LEAK. UPON RETURNING HOME, I HAD NO LEAKS COMING FROM THE JEEP FOR 2 WEEKS.THEN THE LEAKS STARTED. I WENT BACK TO KKL ON 10/9/19 WHERE THEY PUT DYE IN THE ENGINE TO FIND THE LEAK. ON 10/14/19 THEY SAW NO DYE IN THE ENGINE, THEREBY NOTING THAT IT WAS TRANSMISSION. I WENT TO TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY RIGHT AFTER, & I WAS ADVISED THAT I HAD A GERMAN TRANSMISSION & THE TRANSMISSION PUMP, SEALS, ETC.

HE CHANGED THE OIL OUT, CLEANED OUT THE ENGINE BUT DIDN'T FIND ANY ISSUES WITH THE OIL TANK OR HOSES. A YEAR LATER, NOW AT 40,000 MILES, MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT SUDDENLY COMES ON. MECHANIC READS A \"MISFIRE\" ERROR. HE CHANGES OUT ALL MY SPARK PLUGS, THE IGNITION COIL AND THE PLENUM GASKET. CLEANS OUT THE FUEL INJECTORS AND THE CAR IS HUMMING BEAUTIFULLY AGAIN. BUT 5 DAYS LATER, AGAIN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. MECHANIC CHECKS EVERYTHING HE DID AND CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. HE RESEARCHED AND THINKS IT COULD BE THE EXHAUST VALVE SEATS BEING WORN OUT. RECOMMENDS I TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. LOW AND BEHOLD, THEY DISCOVER THAT A CYLINDER HEAD NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED! APPARENTLY AN ISSUE THEY KEEP ENCOUNTERING FREQUENTLY IN THIS MODEL. I'VE SEEN IT POSTED ON A BUNCH OF THREADS REGARDING JEEPS. THANK GOODNESS I WAS 4 DAYS AWAY FROM MY 5 YEAR WARRANTY TO EXPIRE WHEN THIS HAPPENED!!!! I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON ALL THE 2014 JEEPS TO MAKE SURE THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL. MY VIN DID NOT SHOW A RECALL PER YOUR SYSTEM, BUT ALL 2014 JEEPS SHOULD BE CHECKED SINCE IT'S OCCURRING SO FREQUENTLY, AND PEOPLE WILL BE OUT OF THEIR WARRANTY SOON WITH THAT YEAR'S MODEL.",

THE OIL MIXING WITH THE COOLANT CAUSED IT TO TURN INTO A THICK MUD-LIKE CONSISTENCY THAT CLOGGED UP THE COOLING SYSTEM AND AFTER LETTING IT COOL DOWN I OPENED THE RADIATOR THEN A THICK BROWN OILY/COOLANT MIXTURE SEEPED OUT OF THE RADIATOR. SO THE RADIATOR WAS HOLDING PRESSURE PRIOR TO BRINGING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE JEEP DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE OIL COOLER HOUSING UNDER WARRANTY ALONG WITH THE RADIATOR HOSES BUT IS NOW SAYING MY RADIATOR HAS A HOLE IN IT AND NOT HOLDING PRESSURE AND THEY ARE REFUSING TO COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY, DESPITE THE JEEP NOT HAVING ANY MECHANICAL ISSUES PRIOR TO A HOLE BLOWING OPEN IN THE ENGINE AND LEAKING OUT OIL. THE JEEP DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO TEST THE ENGINE ANY FURTHER EVEN THOUGH IT RAN FOR 10 MINUTES WITH LITTLE TO NO OIL IN IT WHICH MOST LIKELY CAUSED PRE-MATURE WEAR. THE JEEP DEALERSHIP WANTS ME TO PAY $800+ FOR A NEW RADIATOR. I BOUGHT THIS JEEP 40 DAYS AGO FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND IT'S STILL COVERED UNDER THE 100,000 MILE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.

SERVICE ADVISOR ADMITTED TO HAVING SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. WHEN PICKING UP VEHICLE, SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT PROBLEM WAS DUE TO EXCESSIVE DIRT ON/BEHIND THE GAS PEDAL. THERE IS NO WAY IT WAS CAUSED BY THIS, AS JEEP HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN OFF-ROAD, NO ONE DRIVES IT WITH MUDDY SHOES, ETC. ACCELERATOR PEDAL ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED AND PCM WAS UPDATED TO THE MOST CURRENT SOFTWARE LEVEL.

NOT SURE IF THE STUCK ACCELERATOR IS DUE TO A COMPUTER/SOFTWARE GLITCH OR A MECHANICAL FAILURE.

I NOTICED A CRACK IN THE WINDOW ON THE PASSENGER SIDE RUNNING FROM THE BOTTOM TOWARD THE TOP, APPROXIMATELY 4\"-5\" LONG THAT HAD NOT BEEN THERE BEFORE.  AFTER 15 MINUTES THE CRACK SPREAD TO 6\" ACROSS AND THEN BACK DOWN THE WINDSHIELD TO THE POINT WHERE IT PARTLY BLOCKED THE FRONT WINDSHIELD.  THE WINDOW FEELS PERFECTLY SMOOTH, BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CAR.  IT CLEARLY FORMED INSIDE THE WINDOW.  I TOOK THE JEEP TO THE LOCAL DEALER WHO SAID IT WAS A STRESS FRACTURE PROBABLY DUE TO FREEZING CONDITIONS ALONG WITH THE HEAT FROM THE DEFROSTER. THE INDIVIDUAL I SPOKE WITH CONCEDED IT WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT SINCE HE HAD HEARD OF \"A LOT OF OTHER CASES LIKE MINE\" BUT WOULD NOT BE QUOTED ON THAT.  HE CONTACTED CHRYSLER WHO REFUSED TO COVER THE WINDSHIELD DAMAGE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR SEVEN MONTHS, THE MILEAGE WAS OVER 12,000.
