I CONTACTED THE CRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER ON THE INTERNET TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND IF IN FACT THE MANIFOLD WAS REDESIGNED AS I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I WASN'T JUST INSTALLING ANOTHER DEFECTIVE EXHAUST MANIFOLD. THERE ARE AFTERMARKET EXHAUST MANIFOLDS THAT CARRY AN UNLIMITED WARRANTY AND ARE IN FACT LESS EXPENSIVE, UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A HEAVY DEMAND FOR THEM WITH A LONG WAIT. CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE WOULD NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ANY INFORMATION, JUST BOILER PLATE RESPONSES THANKING ME FOR CONTACTING THEM. I ORDERED A NEW REPLACEMENT EXHAUST MANIFOLD FROM THE DEALER, AND WHEN I WENT TO PICK IT UP, BOTH THE SERVICE AND PARTS MANAGERS INDICATED THAT THEY NEW OF NO PROBLEMS WITH THE WRANGLER EXHAUST MANIFOLD CRACKING. WHEN I ASKED IF THE MANIFOLD WAS REDESIGNED, THEY INDICATED THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW. WHEN I GOT HOME AND OPENED THE BOX CONTAINING THE REPLACEMENT MANIFOLD, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE MANIFOLD WAS INDEED REDESIGNED! THEY ADDED BELLOWS THERMAL EXPANSION JOINTS IN THE FIRST AND SIXTH EXHAUST PIPES. APPARENTLY THE LENGTH OF THE MANIFOLD COUPLED WITH THERMAL EXPANSION, JUST RIPS APART THE MANIFOLD. WHILE I DID NOT HAVE A FIRE IN MY ENGINE COMPARTMENT, AS SOME HAVE HAD, THE UNDERSIDE OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS BLACK FROM THE LEAKING EXHAUST, AND WAS INDEED EVIDENT IN THE CAR WHEN DRIVING.

THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE GEAR SHIFT ( WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE PARKED POSITION) BUT NEVER GAVE ANY SPECIFICS. MY INSURANCE AND I ENDED UP PAYING A TOTAL OF ABOUT $9,000 DOLLARS. THE REPAIRS TOOK A MONTH AND A HALF, IN WHICH MY INSURANCE PAID FOR A RENTAL CAR. WHEN I ASKED ABOUT HAVING THE POWERTRAIN INVESTIGATED BY AN OUTSIDE MECHANIC THEY OFFERED TO \"SELL\" IT TO ME FOR $1000 DOLLARS. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE MANUFACTURER SHORTLY THEREAFTER, AND NEVER TO THIS DAY HAVE RECEIVED A REPLY. AFTER READING THE ARTCILE IN THE NEWSPAPER TODAY ABOUT THE DEFECTS IN THE GRAND CHEROKEES IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT MY JEEP AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. THE SITUATIONS WITH OTHERS WAS EXACTLY LIKE MY EXPERIENCE EXCEPT THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THE WRANGLERS YEARS 1995-1999 ALSO FOR SIMILAR ACCIDENTS.

CALLED CHRYSLER HELP LINE AND TOLD MAYBE COLD WATER OR RAIN GOT ON IT AND AGREED I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT EXTENDED WARRENTY.  WHY ISN'T THE MANIFOLD COVERED UNDER THE EMISSION CONTROL WARRENTY.  WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN GETTING THE EXHAUST GAS TO THE CONVERTER?  INSTEAD IT GOES TO THE AIR AND CREATES A SAFETY PROBLEM IF IT GETS IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.  I SEE YOUR DATA BANK HAS OTHER MANIFOLD FAILURES ALREDY AND SERVICE NOTICES OF HEAD BOLT MAIFOLD ISSUES.  LOOKS LIKE A MFG. DEFECT SINCE THESE VEHICLES ARE SO YOUNG.  THE FUEL PUMP WAS FIXED UNDER WARRENTY, THE CAR WOULD'T START RIGHT.  THE POWER STEERING UNIT CONTINUES TO LEAK SLOWLY AND THE DEALER SUGGEST A SEAL LEAKING BUT I HAVE TO PAY TO FIX.  GREAT CAR!",
