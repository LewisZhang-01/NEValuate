IN ADDITION, MY ELECTRONIC SWAY BAR DISCONNECT SYSTEM WOULD NOT RE-ENGAGE AFTER A CAMPING TRIP. I DROVE DOWN A MOUNTAIN PASS AND ON A STRETCH OF 75 MPH INTERSTATE WITHOUT A SWAY AND AN AIR BAG WHICH WAS DANGEROUS. I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP TO GET BOTH ISSUES LOOKED AT. JEEP CONFIRMED IT WAS THE CLOCKWORK SPRING CAUSING THE AIR BAG LIGHT ($48.00 DIAGNOSIS) AND THAT THE SWAY BAR DISCONNECT MOTOR ($96.00 DIAGNOSIS) HAD FAILED. THEY QUOTED ME FOR $410 TO GET THE CLOCKWORK SPRING FIXED & $1410 TO REPLACE THE SWAY BAR. NO PROMISE WAS MADE TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR COST SHOULD THE ISSUES BECOME RECALLS SINCE THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION. I TOOK INITIATIVE TO SELF DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE SWAY BAR NOT RECONNECTING SINCE I SUSPECTED THAT THE ELECTRONIC MOTOR WAS STILL FUNCTIONING (I COULD HEAR AND FEEL TO MOTOR OPERATING BEFORE & AFTER I TOOK MY VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE). AFTER DISASSEMBLING (NEVER BEEN TAMPERED WITH PRIOR), I FOUND WATER AND RUSTY PARTS INSIDE AND COULD SEE THAT THE UNIT AS POORLY DESIGNED JUDGING FROM THE ONE SMALL SPRING THAT IS SUPPOSE TO WORK TO RE-ENGAGE THE SWAY BAR BY PUSHING THE INTERNAL GEARS (NOW RUSTY) BACK TOGETHER. I SIMPLY APPLIED SOME GREASE TO THE PARTS AND REINSTALLED THE UNIT. TO MY DELIGHT THIS ALLOWED THE MOTOR TO RECONNECT THE SWAY BAR. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE TO PUT MOTORIST IN HARMS WAY WITHOUT A FUNCTIONING AIR BAG SYSTEM AND / OR SWAY BAR DUE TO POORLY VEHICLE CONSTRUCTION AND THEN CHARGE FOR DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR COSTS.

THESE LIGHTS CONSTANTLY HOLD WATER AND WE HAVE TO EMPTY THEM REPEATEDLY AND THE WATER NEVER SEEMS TO EMPTY COMPLETELY.  THESE LIGHTS ALSO SEEM TO BE AFFECTED BY WIRING AS THEY DO NOT ALWAYS ILLUMINATE DESPITE AN EFFECTIVE BULB.  WE TOOK IT IN FOR REPAIRS UNDER OUR PURCHASED WARRANTY AND THE DEALERSHIP STATES THERE IS WATER DAMAGE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT WIRE PROTECTION.  THIS IS VERY CONCERNING AS WATER IS AN EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY.  REGARDLESS OF THE USED CONDITION OF THE CAR I SEE NO REASON WHY THIS SHOULD BE THE CASE AS WIRING SEEMS VERY MUCH LIKE A MANUFACTURE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY.    -WHEELS:  THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED WITH ALL ORIGINAL WHEELS (NOT TIRES) AND THE VALVE STEMS ON EACH WHEEL HAVE DISINTEGRATED COMPLETELY AND CRUMBLED APART.  WE REALIZED THIS WHEN THE LOW AIR LIGHT CAME ON AND WE WENT TO FILL THE TIRES THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO EFFECT HOW WELL THE TIRES CAN HOLD AIR.    -SPEEDOMETER: ORIGINALLY WHEN WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THE SPEEDOMETER WAS OFF BY ABOUT 10MPH (WE DID NOT KNOW THIS UNTIL DRIVING TWO SEPARATE CARS AND THINKING \"HMM IS THE OTHER DRIVER REALLY SPEEDING THAT MUCH?\"  CALL ONE ANOTHER ON THE PHONE AND DETERMINED THE SUBARU WOULD DRIVE 60MPH AND SEE WHAT SPEED THE JEEP CLAIMED TO BE DRIVING WHEN MATCHED.    WE HAD THIS ISSUE \"FIXED\" ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND NOW IT IS EVEN WORSE.  UPON DOING THE SAME SPEED TEST THE JEEP WAS NOW 12MPH OVER WHAT IT SHOULD BE.

THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS THE HORN DOES NOT WORK, AND I AM UNSURE IF MY AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY, IF NEEDED. THERE IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE AS THERE ARE A FLOOD OF COMPLAINTS. IT IS TIME FOR THE NHTSA TO STEP IN AND GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF. I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY $500.00 TO HAVE THE CLOCK-SPRING FIXED WHEN IT IS AN OBVIOUS ISSUE ACROSS THE LINE IN THE 2007 AND 2008 MODELS.    I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT I HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\" WHICH IS WHAT WAS THE INITIAL ISSUE WHICH HAD ME TAKE THE JEEP INTO THE SHOP. OVER THIS PAST YEAR, THE JEEP WOULD JUST START SHAKING VIOLENTLY AT ABOUT 55 MPH EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. THIS LAST TIME, I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, TURNED OFF THE JEEP AND TRIED AGAIN, ONLY TO HAVE IT START SHAKING VIOLENTLY AGAIN. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT NEEDS ADDRESSED. I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED AS THERE WERE VEHICLES ON THE FREEWAY ALL AROUND ME. I COULD BARELY CONTROL THE VEHICLE TO PULL IT OFF THE ROAD. THE MECHANIC REPLACED THE STEERING STABILIZER, THE CALIPERS, AND THE ROTORS TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM. INTERESTINGLY, WHEN I WALKED IN TO TALK TO THEM, THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS AS THEY HAVE HAD SIMILAR COMPLAINTS THAT NEEDED REPAIRS FOR THE SAME VEHICLE AND PROBLEM FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS WAS A $350.00 REPAIR. I POINT THIS SECOND ISSUE OUT SO OTHER JEEP OWNERS WILL KNOW WHAT TO HAVE REPAIRED IF CHRYSLER DOES NOTHING.  *TR",

I SUSPECT THE REAL REASON FOR ALLOWING CHRYSLER OFF THE HOOK IS THE COST INVOLVED TO WARRANTY THE REST OF THE VEHICLES.

I WAS ON I-35W NORTH GOING AROUND A LONG EASY LEFT CORNER IN THE ROAD WHEN I HIT A ROUGH AREA IN THE HIGHWAY.  THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS SHAKING HARD LEFT AND RIGHT.  I IMMEDIATELY GRASPED THE WHEEL AS FIRMLY AS POSSIBLE AND SLOWED THE VEHICLE TO APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES AN HOUR BEFORE THE SHAKING STOPPED.

I CALLED ANOTHER DEALER AND THE SERVICE TECH (IN 2010) MENTIONED, \"JEEP WOBBLE\"- I GOOGLED IT AND FOUND VERY LITTLE INFO- JUST SOME JEEP OWNER BLOGS THAT DESCRIBED EXACTLY WHAT I FELT. THE DEALER FIXED THE PROBLEM (UNDER WARRANTY) BY REPLACING THE STEERING COLUMN SHOCK (OR SOMETHING). SINCE I HAD IT REPAIRED, I STILL EXPERIENCED THE NORMAL, MINOR VIBRATION THAT HAPPENS AROUND 55 MPH. RECENTLY (JAN 2013) THE DEATH WOBBLE RETURNED WITH A VENGEANCE. REGARDLESS OF ROAD CONDITIONS, AT 57 MPH IT SHAKES SO BADLY THAT IT FEELS LIKE I WILL LOOSE CONTROL. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WILL REPLACE THE SHOCK AGAIN AND THEY MENTIONED THAT THE PART HAS BEEN IMPROVED WITH BRACKETS OR SOME SUCH. OF COURSE, AT 57000 MILES, IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I HAD TO PAY THE $230 FOR THE REPAIR. THE TECH TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE AND I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO REPLACE IT AGAIN IN ANOTHER 25000 MILES. I CALL BS!  THE JEEP HAS NEVER BEEN OFF-ROAD, NEVER MISTREATED, ALWAYS MAINTAINED. NEITHER DEALER NOR MANUFACTURER EVER MENTIONED THIS TSB  DURING THE 2013 REPAIR. WHEN I PICKED IT UP, IT WAS NOT FIXED. JEEP CO. HAS AGREED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR ALL BUT $100 (DEDUCTIBLE) BUT WHY DO I HAVE TO KEEP PAYING FOR REPAIRS ON A KNOWN ISSUE? VIBRATION IS SO BAD, IT COULD CAUSE ME TO WRECK.  *TR",

(I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE TOWN OF ORCHARD PARK ON HIGHWAY 20A.  I THOUGHT IT STRANGE BUT KNEW IT WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO EVEN A SLIGHT CHANGE IN PRESSURE.)  I PROCEEDED TO ENTER THE 219, INCREASING  SPEED TO 60 MPH, WHEN I SUDDENLY REALIZED I HAD LOST ALL PRESSURE IN MY RIGHT REAR TIRE.  I MANAGED TO SAFELY EXIT THE HIGHWAY AND TO CALL MY HUSBAND TO CHANGE THE TIRE.  WHILE DOING SO, HE NOTICED THE ENTIRE VALVE STEM WAS MISSING.  THERE WAS JUST A HOLE WHERE IT HAD BEEN.  HE ASSUMED THAT THE NUT THAT HOLDS THE TPMS HAD WORKED ITS WAY LOOSE AND THAT IT WAS INSIDE THE TIRE.  HE TOOK THE TIRE TO WEST-HERR CHRYSLER JEEP AND THEY REINSERTED THE TPMS AND REPLACED THE MOUNTING NUT.  ABOUT A YEAR LATER, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN - INSTANT DEFLATION - WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON I-190 (ABOUT 50 MILES/HOUR), ONLY THIS TIME IT WAS MY LEFT REAR TIRE.  AGAIN, I MANAGED TO EXIT  SAFELY AND  TO AGAIN CALL MY HUSBAND.  THIS TIME HE COULDN'T GET THE TIRE OFF THE HUB SO WE CALLED AAA.  WHILE WAITING FOR THEM, A FELLOW JEEP OWNER STOPPED TO RENDER ASSISTANCE AND HE POINTED OUT THAT THE NUT HOLD THE TPMS ON THE LEFT FRONT TIRE WAS CORRODED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ALSO.  (MY HUSBAND WHO HAS A PH.D. IN CHEMISTRY FROM INDIANA U. NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE VALVE STEM IS ALUMINUM AND IT IS IN CONTACT WITH THE STEEL WHEEL.  HE POSTULATED THAT THE TWO UNLIKE METALS ACTED AS A CELL AND WITH THE SALT THAT IS USED ON THE ROADS HERE THAT LED TO VERY RAPID CORROSION.)

TWO WEEKS LATER, THE SHAKING OCCURRED AGAIN AND SOON IT BECAME INCREASINGLY VIOLENT ,MAKING IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND STAY IN HIS LANE. THE CONSUMER RETURNED TO THE REPAIR SHOP WHERE THEY REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPER, WHICH SEEMED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM FOR AWHILE. IN JULY, THE CONSUMER TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR A ROUTINE MAINTENANCE CHECK. WHILE CHECKING THE FRONT END, THE MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO GET TWO FULL TURNS ON A NUT ON THE TRACK BAR. SINCE THEN, THE SHAKING HAS NOT OCCURRED. THE CONSUMER STATED AS HE APPROACHED A LINE OF VEHICLES STOPPED AT A LIGHT, HE ATTEMPTED TO APPLY THE BRAKE, BUT IT WENT SOFT AND TO THE FLOOR. AN INSPECTION REVEALED A HOLE IN THE BRAKE LINE ABOVE THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL, WHERE THE LINE LEFT THE WHEEL WELL AND WENT INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.

CONSEQUENCE:    A BROKEN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT IN THE AIRBAG CLOCKSPRING WIRING ASSEMBLY CAN LEAD TO NON-DEPLOYMENT OF THE DRIVER FRONTAL AIRBAG AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROPERLY PROTECT THE DRIVER IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH, INCREASING THE RISK OF INJURIES.  REMEDY:    CHRYSLER WILL NOTIFY OWNERS AND REMEDY THE VEHICLES AS NECESSARY FREE OF CHARGE. CHRYSLER WILL MAIL TO OWNERS AN INTERIM NOTIFICATION DURING DECEMBER 2011. OWNERS MAY CONTACT CHRYSLER AT 1-800-853-1403.  NOTES:    CHRYSLER'S RECALL NUMBER IS L37.

I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE, EXCEPT A MONTH AGO I STARTED EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE GAS SHOOTING OUT OF THE TANK NEAR THE END OF FILLING UP.        I COULD AVOID THE PROBLEM ONLY IF I SHUT OFF THE GAS AS IT NEARED THE TOP (BEFORE THE POINT WHEN IT IS SHUT OFF BY THE NOZZLE??S OWN MECHANISM). HOWEVER IF I FILLED THE TANK ON THE JEEP AS I DO ON OUR OTHER CAR (AND AS I DID ON THE JEEP PRIOR TO LAST MONTH), THE GAS WOULD SHOOT OUT OF THE TANK, SPILLING ON THE SIDE AND ON MY FINGERS, AND ON ONE OCCASION, ON MY PANT LEG. I CONSIDER THIS PROBLEM OF GAS SPILLING OUTSIDE THE CAR A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION WHICH NEEDS TO BE REMEDIED.      I HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY RECALL OR SERVICE ACTION NOTICES FROM THE MANUFACTURER ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. SO I DID AN INTERNET SEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD ISSUED A RECALL FOR 2007 AND 2008 WRANGLERS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN MARCH 2007-MARCH 2008. I CHECKED MY VEHICLE AND DETERMINED IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN MAY 2008. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM WAS THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM COMPLAINED ABOUT AND WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE RECALL.  I THEREFORE CONTACTED MY DEALER AND WAS EVENTUALLY ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FUEL TANK AS AN EMISSION PROBLEM COVERED BY A LIFETIME WARRANTY.  I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK IT ADVISABLE FOR THE MANUFACTURER BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY ITS OWNERS OF THIS PROBLEM AND/OR ISSUE A RECALL OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES.

HE SAID THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 OF THESE MODULES BACKORDERED ACROSS THE NATION AND COULDN'T TELL US WHETHER IT WOULD BE DAYS OR WEEKS UNTIL IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE.  WHEN I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER IF THE VEHICLE WOULD BE SAFE TO DRIVE, HE SAID THAT WE COULD LOSE TOTAL CONTROL AT ANY TIME WITHOUT WARNING.  CONSIDERING THIS AND THE ELECTRICAL ARCING WE HEARD UNDER THE HOOD, I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD CONSTITUTE A SAFETY RECALL.  OTHER JEEP OWNERS HAVE REPORTED SIMILAR ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS AT HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/.  *TR",

IT FEELS LIKE THE FRONT TIRES ARE GOING TO FLY OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS! AFTER THE FIRST OCCURRENCE, IT DID NOT HAPPEN AGAIN FOR MONTHS, BUT RECENTLY HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES.  I WAS TOLD BY ONE GARAGE THAT IT WAS DUE TO TIRE BALANCE (WHICH I KNEW WAS NOT THE CASE), BUT I HAD ALL FOUR TIRES BALANCED/ROTATED (AT ABOUT 42,500 MILES).  GARAGE PERSONNEL STATED THIS \"TOOK CARE OF MOST OF THE PROBLEM\" BUT SUGGESTED I GET NEW TIRES.   PROBLEM OCCURRED 2 MORE TIMES WITHIN A WEEK, BEFORE NEW TIRES.  HAVE HAD ALL FOUR TIRES REPLACED.  DEATH WOBBLE HAS NOT RECURRED, BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TIRES/BALANCE AND THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING.

I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER BUT THEY WOULD NOT FIX IT BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET THE PROBLEM TO REOCCUR.  IT TOOK CHRYSLER 1 YEAR BEFORE THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM.

NOW I AM BATTLING TO TRY AND GET THE DEALER TO FIX IT AGAIN.

THE FIRST STALL OCCURRED IN MY DRIVEWAY WITH MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS IN THE VEHICLE.  I WAS ABLE TO JUST MOVE THE KIDS INTO THE HOUSE WITH NO REAL SAFETY INCIDENT.
