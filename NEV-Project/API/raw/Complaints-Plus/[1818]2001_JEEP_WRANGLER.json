THIS WENT ON FOR ANOTHER ROUNDTRIP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  UPON RETURNING HOME THE FOLLOWING DAY I SAW SOMETHING HANGING FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE.  IT WAS THE SKID PLATE, HANGING BY THE PASSENGER'S SIDE BOLTS, SUPPORTING THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF THE DRIVETRAIN.  THE DRIVESHAFT BEING AT THAT UNNATURAL ANGLE IS WHAT CAUSED THE LOSS OF POWER.  TO THINK THAT I HAD DRIVEN 100 MILES THAT WAY WAS SLIGHTLY UNSETTLING.  SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD THE FRAME WELDED, WHICH RAN $1,200.  I HAVE SINCE HAD THE REAR RAILS (BEHIND REAR WHEELS) REPAIRED FOR AN ADDITIONAL $400.  MY FRONT BODY MOUNT HAS ALSO ROTTED OUT, WHICH I FIXED MYSELF FOR $10, BUT SHOULD PROBABLY BE WELDED BY A PROFESSIONAL.  BOTH MECHANIC AND WELDER SUGGESTED THAT FRAME ROT OCCURRED DUE TO LACK OF HOLES FOR WATER TO DRAIN OUT AND THAT THE SITTING WATER AND SALT JUST ATE AWAY AT EVERYTHING.  THE CAR NOW HAS 215,000 MILES ON IT.  I AM OTHERWISE HAPPY WITH THE CAR, BUT IT UPSETS ME THAT I COULD HAVE HAD A MAJOR ACCIDENT DUE TO THE POOR DESIGN OF THE FRAME.  SEEMS STRANGE THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FIX FOR THE ISSUE, NOR A RESPONSE FROM CHRYSLER TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CAN DIE AS A RESULT OF THE FRAME ROTTING OUT.  MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR A FIX?!?  AT 200,000+ MILES YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD GO STRAIGHT BACK TO A WRANGLER ONCE THIS ONE BITES IT, BUT I WILL NEVER BUY A JEEP AGAIN BASED ON THIS ISSUE.  I BOUGHT THIS AS A 25 YEAR OLD WITHOUT KIDS.  WITH A 2 AND 4 YEAR OLD AT HOME, I WOULD NOT TRUST A JEEP TO TRANSPORT THEM (TOO BAD, AS MY SON LOVES MY JEEP DESPITE NEVER BEING IN IT).

WHEN I GOT HOME, I SCRATCHED THE RUST WITH MY FINGERNAIL AND WAS EASILY ABLE TO POKE MY FINGER RIGHT THROUGH THE FRAME. A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH REVEALED THE FRAME ROT IS A VERY COMMON DESIGN FLAW FOR THE WRANGLER TJ SERIES. APPARENTLY MOISTURE, ROAD DEBRIS, ETC. IS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE INTERIOR OF THE FRAME BUT NOTHING IN THE DESIGN ALLOWS FOR ITS EXIT. SINCE THIS CREATES A CONDITION THAT ALLOWS THE FRAME TO ROT FROM THE INSIDE-OUT, BY THE TIME IT IS DISCOVERED IT IS TYPICALLY TOO LATE. MANY COMPANIES NOW MANUFACTURE SPECIAL FRAME PIECES TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES WHO ARE MADE AWARE OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR BEFORE TOO MUCH DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE.

I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONTINUES TO OCCUR IN OTHER TJ MODEL YEARS AS WELL SO I THINK IT IS A SYSTEMIC DESIGN PROBLEM THAT IF NOT CORRECTED BY THE MANUFACTURER WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE A SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.      MY CASE IS TYPICAL OF THE FAILURES DESCRIBED BY OTHER 2001 WRANGLER OWNERS IN THAT THE HEATER BLOWER FAN SWITCH BEGAN TO DROP SPEEDS UNTIL ONLY THE HIGHEST SPEED WAS LEFT OPERATIONAL [WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS HOW THE UNDERLYING ELECTRONICS SPECIFICALLY A RESISTOR BANK FAIL IN THIS MODEL].  RECENTLY, THIS 4TH SPEED HAS FAILED AND I AM NOT DRIVING THE VEHICLE UNTIL I CAN RECEIVE SOME ASSURANCE THAT THE HEATER BLOWER WILL NOT CONTINUE TO HEAT UP UNTIL IT CATCHES FIRE AS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN OTHER INSTANCES.  AS I WRITE THIS COMPLAINT, IT IS ABOUT 25 DEGREES OUTSIDE, SO DRIVING MY 2001 WRANGLER WITHOUT HEAT IS NOT AN OPTION.  I GUESS I AM LUCKY THAT (A) IT FAILED COMPLETELY IN COLD WEATHER FORCING ME TO (B) RESEARCH THE ISSUE LEARNING THAT (C) THIS OBVIOUS VEHICLE DEFECT CAN RESULT IN THE WRANGLER CATCHING FIRE WHICH HAS FORCED ME TO (D) GO WITHOUT THE USE OF THE WRANGLER UNTIL A FACTORY DESIGNED AND SPONSORED FIX IS ENGINEERED AND INSTALLED.    SO, IN SUMMARY, 2001 WRANGLER ' FAILED HEATER/FAN/BLOWER SWITCH ' MANY OTHER CASES FOR THIS MODEL YEAR AND SURROUNDING MODEL YEARS ' HAS A HISTORY OF CAUSING VEHICLE FIRES ' THIS NEEDS TO BE A FACTORY SPONSORED RE-ENGINEER AND RECALL, AND NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW BEFORE A FIRE SITUATION CAUSES A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR INJURY OR DEATH ! *TR",

IT WAS NOT UNTIL I BROKE DOWN IN CT, WHERE ANOTHER JEEP DEALERSHIP, GEORGETOWN JEEP DEALERSHIP, TOLD ME ABOUT A DYE TEST SHOULD BE PERFORMED.  WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY ORIGINAL DEALER, I HAD TO ARGUE WITH THEM TO PERFORM THE DYE TEST, BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO PRESSURIZE MY JEEP...AGAIN.

EVENTUALLY, THROUGH COMPLAINING THE THIS PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND ON MY PREVIOUS VISITS BEFORE MY WARRANTY EXPIRED, THEY DID A \"GOOD WILL\" JOB.  I STILL ENDED UP PAYING A GOOD PORTION.
