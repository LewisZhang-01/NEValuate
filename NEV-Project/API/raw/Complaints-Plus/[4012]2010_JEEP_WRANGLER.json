This issue is common and described across the web but is a safety hazard! The headlights will flash 3-5 times then completely shut off. Restarting the Jeep and disconnecting the battery does not help. Jeep dealer says circuit in the TIPM is the issue and that this is common! Lordy have mercy for all the vecs on the road when my headlights started flashing at them and then went out on, of course,  an unlit section of the road. But the crazier part is Jeep knew this could happen and doesn't warn the customers. I sure  did not know that I might be driving blind at night becoming a safety hazard. The lights then decide to not work for a few days before going back to being reliable for anywhere from weeks to months until you happen to drive at night again and bam they go out again. Luckily the runner/ fog lights are unaffected but as a primary vehicle I can not just keep taking ubers every time it is dark outside! This is such a serious safety issue to loose your lights while driving! There are two common fixes for this. One you buy the TIPM or two you buy non stock headlights and reroute them to your own switch but for most of us, buying a part that Jeep knows will break is crazy and not practical (plus WE the consumer didn't know it would) and the alternative of having to buy a different company's lights to buy pass the wiring in just crazy.  It is such a serious issue I do not understand why there is no recall! I'm also so unsure if I can even pass a safety inspection anymore.    Also the automatic fuel stopper does not work which is ANOTHER know glitch with the TIPM. This is okay if you know about it because you can hold the handle the whole time while filling up but you can not trust it alone. It isn't like it is all the time either. Just enough to keep you on your toes and plosion the ground with spillage. The first time is scary though.",

SEE ATTACHMENTS FOR DIGITAL PICS TAKEN THROUGHOUT THE REPAIR PROCESS, AND EXCERPTS FROM THE MAINTENANCE LOGBOOK I MAINTAIN ON THIS VEHICLE.    I HAVE ANOTHER, NEWER (2014) JEEP WRANGLER THAT HAS THE SAME FLEXIBLE BRAKE-HOSE INSTALLATION AT BUILD.  I INTEND TO REMOVE/REPLACE THOSE HOSES AT NEXT SCHEDULED INSPECTION, IN APPROX 6-8 WEEKS.  I WILL REPORT FINDINGS AND LINK TO THIS REPORT.    PLEASE CONTACT ME AT THE EMAIL/PHONE PROVIDED, OR AT MY WORK EMAIL:  [XXX]    I BELIEVE LIKELIHOOD OF LIKE-FAILURES IS HIGH, SEVERITY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC. THANK YOU!

IT LITERALLY FEELS LIKE THE AXEL IS GOING TO SNAP IN HALF OR THE VEHICLE MAY EVEN FLIP IF THE SHAKING WERE TO CONTINUE. WHEN THE VEHICLE IS SHAKING LIKE THIS THE ONLY WAY I'VE EXPERIENCED FOR IT TO STOP IS QUICKLY SLOWING DOWN ALMOST TO A COMPLETE STOP.

I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY AND REMOVED THE FUSE BOX COVER, THERE WERE MELTED FUSES IN THE BOX AND I COULD SEE SOME MELTED WIRES UNDER THE FUSE BOX. I CALLED A LOCAL BODY SHOP TO COME AND PICK UP OUR JEEP. I CALLED MY INSURANCE AND FILLED A CLAIM. SINCE THERE WAS NO FIRE WE HAD NO CLAIM. I RENTED A TOW DOLLY AND TOOK IT TO STATELINE DODGE IN FORT MILL, S.C. I DECIDED TO CALL JEEP FOR HELP. THEY SENT SOMEONE FROM ENGINEERING ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT HAPPEN. I DON'T REMEMBER HIS NAME BUT HE TOLD ME IT WAS A MASSIVE TIPM FAILURE.

I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE NEW SO I KNOW THE COMPLETE VEHICLE HISTORY AND SERVICE.  AFTER FILLING UP YESTERDAY AND GETTING SOAKED WITH GASOLINE AGAIN, I HAD ENOUGH!  TIME TO COMPLAIN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  THIS IS REALLY A SERIOUS ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET SERIOUSLY INJURED IF THIS IS NOT CORRECTED.  MANY TIMES I SEE PEOPLE AROUND GAS PUMPS SMOKING AND NOW I NOT ONLY HAVE TO WATCH WHAT I'M DOING, I NEED TO MAKE SURE NOBODY AROUND ME IS DOING ANYTHING CARELESS THAT COULD CAUSE ME HARM!  EMAIL WAS SENT OFF TO CHRYSLER - WAITING FOR RESPONSE AS WELL AS INFO FROM MY DEALER.  *TR",

AT ABOUT 18K MILES, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING THE COMMON DREADED \"DEATH WOBBLE\". I WAS DRIVING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEATS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHILE HITTING A SMALL BUMP IN THE ROAD, THE STEERING WHEEL BEGAN RAPIDLY MOVING BACK AND FORTH AND THE FRONTEND OF THE VEHICLE WAS SHAKING VIOLENTLY. I QUICKLY STOPPED THE VEHICLE, CHECKED ON MY NOW FRIGHTENED CHILDREN, THEN GO OUT TO EXAMINE MY VEHICLE. I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING OBVIOUS, LIKE TIE RODS OR BALL JOINTS. SO, I SLOWLY DROVE HOME. I WENT OVER THE ENTIRE FRONT END. COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. AFTER READING A LOT OF FORUMS ON THE MATTER, I FOUND I AM ONE OF MANY JEEP OWNERS THAT HAVE/ARE FIGHTING THIS SAME ISSUE. I WENT AHEAD AND PUT ON A NEW STEERING STABILIZER, AND TRACKBARS, AS THESE ARE CLAIMED TO BE THE MOST COMMON ISSUES (EVEN THOUGH MINE LOOKED FINE AND HAD NO PLAY). I CONTINUALLY HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM AND HAVE HAD IT TO SHOP FOR AN ALIGNMENT, TIRE ROTATIONS, AND CHECKING THE BALANCING ON THE TIRES. THE SHOP SAID TIRES AND ALIGNMENT WERE FINE. WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS SOME PLAY IN THE SECTOR SHAFT WHERE THE PITMAN ARM CONNECTS TO THE STEERING GEARBOX. SOME GUYS ARE SAYING THEY HAVE REPLACED THEIRS 3 TIMES IN 30K MILES. I DON'T OFFROAD,  MY VEHICLE ISN'T EXPOSED TO HARSH CONDITIONS, WHERE ONE COULD EXPECT MECHANICAL FAILURES. I CURRENTLY HAVE 26K MILES ON MINE, AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE, MEANWHILE THROWING $$ AND PARTS ON IT TO TRY AND FIND THE ISSUE. AFTER RESEARCHING AND SEEING THE LARGE AMOUNT OF OWNERS FIGHTING DEATH WOBBLE AND THE COMPONENT FAILURES WHICH CAUSE IT, I FEEL CHRYSLER SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO SOME LEVEL.

WE FOUND IT DID NOT ALWAYS MAKE THE NOISE WHEN I BRAKED. I TOOK MY JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A RECALL AND MENTIONED THE SQUEALING. THEY SAID POLLEN OR OTHER SMALL PARTICLES COULD SETTLE IN THEM AND CAUSE A TEMPORARY SQUEAK. AGAIN, WITH THE TOP ON AND MUSIC PLAYING I DIDN'T HEAR IT. RECENTLY I WAS DRIVING DOWNTOWN WITH MY WINDOWS DOWN AND COULD HEAR THE SHRILL SQUEAL EVERYTIME I HIT A LIGHT. HAVING ANOTHER RECALL TO ATTEND TO AND AN OVERFLOWING GAS TANK ISSUE TO ADDRESS, I DECIDED TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP LOOK AT THE BRAKES. I HAD ALSO NOTICE THE RIDE HAD GOTTEN MUCH ROUGHER AND THE IDLE FELT SHAKY WHEN SITTING IN TRAFFIC. THE TECHNICIAN EXPLAINED HE BELIEVED THERE WAS DEBRIS BETWEEN MY BRAKE PAD AND MY ROTOR WHICH CAUSED SIGNIFICANT PITTING IN THE ROTOR. THE PITTING WAS SO BAD THEY COULD NOT RESURFACE IT, BUT IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. MY HUSBAND QUESTIONED THE LIKELIHOOD FOR SOMETHING TO GET LODGED BETWEEN THE BRAKE PAD AND THE ROTOR AND THE TECHNICIAN AGREED IT WAS UNCOMMON. THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, WAS THEY SAID THE SAME PHENOMENON OCCURRED ON BOTH REAR BRAKES. BOTH? SINCE THE WARRANTY ONLY ADDRESSED THE BRAKES IN THE FIRST YEAR / 12K MILES, HE EXPLAINED THIS WAS NOT COVERED AND I WOULD NEED BOTH ROTORS REPLACED AT FULL COST.  *KB",

I PURCHASED MY JEEP NEW 18 MONTHS AGO AND IT NOW HAS APPROXIMATELY 22K MILES. THEY REPLACED THE GAS TANK WHICH I NOW UNDERSTAND IS A COMMON ISSUE ON THE 2010 RUBICONS. THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO REPLACE BOTH ROTORS WHICH ARE NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY DUE TO DEBRIS GETTING CAUGHT BETWEEN THE BRAKE PAD AND ROTOR ON BOTH REAR BRAKES. AND, THEY EXPLAINED THE LOUD/ROUGH RIDE WAS FROM THE UNEVEN WEAR ON MY FRONT TIRES. THE TREAD ON MY FRONT TIRES SHOWED SEVERE CUPPING. THE TECH SAID IT WAS FROM NOT ROTATING MY TIRES OFTEN ENOUGH AND THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON JEEPS SINCE THE FRONT HAS MORE \"PLAY\" AND THE REAR IS MORE \"SOLID\". HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY JEEP. I QUESTIONED WHETHER THE SIGNIFICANT UNEVEN WEAR WAS ACCEPTABLE AFTER ONLY 22K MILES. HE OFFERED NO OTHER SOLUTION OTHER THAN ROTATING THE DAMAGED TIRES TO THE BACK AND WAIT FOR THEM TO WEAR EVENLY.

IN MAY 2011, APPROXIMATELY A MONTH AFTER MY VEHICLE WAS IN FOR SERVICE, I PARKED MY VEHICLE IN ITS PARKING SPOT AT MY HOUSE AND WHEN I RETURNED TO MY VEHICLE FIVE MINUTES LATER IT HAD ROLLED INTO THE WOODS. WHEN THE JEEP ROLLED INTO THE WOODS IT HIT THREE TREES RESULTING IN THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE FENDER RIPPING OFF. WHEN I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE AT JEEP THEY STATED I NEEDED TO FILE A CLAIM THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD ASSIST ME WITH. A CLAIM WAS FILED THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND CHRYSLER COMPANY. CURRENTLY THE JEEP IS BEING REPAIRED THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY. I FEEL THAT ONCE THE BODY WORK IS COMPLETE ON MY JEEP THE MECHANICAL PARTS OF THE JEEP WILL STILL BE DEFECTIVE. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE PARKING BRAKE WILL FAIL AGAIN AND COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE PROPERTY OR A BYSTANDER. CHRYSLER SENT OUT A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR, HANK SULLIVAN, WHO INSPECTED THE PARKING BRAKE. WHEN REQUESTED TO BE ON SITE OF HIS INVESTIGATION OF MY VEHICLE MY REQUESTED WAS DENIED. ONCE HIS INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE I REQUESTED PAPERWORK TO VERIFY HE EXAMINED MY VEHICLE AND FOR A COPY OF THE RESULTS FOR MY OWN FILE, THAT REQUEST WAS ALSO DENIED. APPROXIMATELY A MONTH LATER, I AM STILL AWAITING A LETTER FROM CHRYSLER WITH DETAILS FROM HANK'S INVESTIGATION. I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM CHRYSLER STATING THAT THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE. I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST DUE TO MY AGE I LEFT SEVERAL MESSAGES FOR THE SPECIAL CLAIMS DEPARTMENT AT CHRYSLER AND NEVER RECEIVED A PHONE CALL BACK. ONLY ONCE I GOT ONE BACK.  *TR",

WE REACHED OUR DESTINATION AND THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF US STOPPED AND EVERYONE GOT OUT AND STARTED TO GATHER THEIR STUFF FROM THE REAR OF THEIR JEEP.  I STOPPED ROUGHLY 10 FT BEHIND THE FIRST VEHICLE ON A SLIGHT INCLINE (10% ANGLE) DOWNWARDS TOWARDS THE FIRST VEHICLE, PUT MY JEEP (AUTO TRANSMISSION) INTO PARK, AND TOOK OUT THE KEY. WE EXITED MY JEEP AND STARTED WALKING TOWARDS THE FIRST JEEP AS I APPROACHED MY FRONT TIRE, THE JEEP STARTED TO MOVE FORWARD AND IT MADE A RATCHETING NOISE FROM THE TRANSMISSION. THE TYPE OF NOISE THAT IS MADE WHEN ONE WOULD PUT A MOVING VEHICLE INTO PARK.      MY JEEP CRASHED INTO THE TAILGATE OF THE FIRST JEEP ALMOST CRUSHING MY FRIEND. FORTUNATELY MY JEEP HIT THE TAILGATE OF THE FIRST JEEP AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE AND THE DOOR WITHHELD THE FORCE OF MY JEEP CRASHING INTO HIS JEEP.      TOOK THE JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THEY WOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX THE JEEP. I DROVE THE JEEP HOME AND WAS ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES, AND WAS ABLE TO REPRODUCE IT CONSISTENTLY IN ANOTHER 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR.. I CREATED A VIDEO OF THE TRANSMISSION FAILING AND SENT IT TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP.      I WAS ABLE TO REPLICATE THE FAILURE BY STOPPING ON A HILL WITH A PRETTY GOOD ANGLE AND CYCLE THROUGH THESE ACTIONS:    PUT FOOT ON BRAKE, PUT JEEP IN DRIVE, DRIVE 2 INCHES, PUT FOOT ON BRAKE, PUT JEEP IN PARK, AND RELEASE BRAKE.
